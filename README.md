## Description
The Average Cost App is a financial tool designed for investors to track and analyze their stock and cryptocurrency investments, all in one place. It allows users to easily assess the impact of additional purchases of an asset on its average cost.

### Key Features:
#### 1. **Asset Management**
Users can add stocks and cryptocurrencies to their portfolio, providing details such as asset name, number of shares owned, average cost, and their additional budget for investment.
#### 2. **Price History Chart**
Displays an up-to-date chart of the price history for each asset.
#### 3. **Average Cost Visualization**
A green line overlays on each price history chart, indicating the user's average cost. This provides a clear visual representation of the user's current investment status.
#### 4. **Interactive Purchase Simulation**
Users can interact with a slider to simulate purchasing more of an asset at its current price. This recalculates and visually demonstrates how the average cost would change with additional purchases.
#### 5. **Networth Calculation**
The home screen lists all added assets and calculates the user's total networth, which can be represented in either US or Canadian dollars.
#### 6. **Local Data Storage**
All user data, including portfolio information, is stored locally on the user's device, ensuring privacy and quick access.
#### 7. **No Database Dependency**
The app operates without an external database, allowing for simplicity and user data privacy.
